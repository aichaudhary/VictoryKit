# Model Recommendations Reliable & Intelligent For Best Performance Overall - Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.5

## Overall Project Workflow
- [x] Merge existing branch and checkout main branch
- [x] Work on main branch for development
- [ ] For each tool: Complete backend, frontend, database (MongoDB), LM integration
- [ ] After completing a tool: Create new branch, commit, push, merge to main, checkout main
- [ ] Repeat cycle for each tool (one tool at a time, 360-degree completion)

- [x] Delete unnecessary parts from copied fguard structure
- [x] Update/upgrade code according to Encryption Manager's specific nature and usage
- [x] Delete any neural-link-interface/ folders in frontend/tools/14-encryptionmanager/
- [x] Remove legacy/duplicate/copy/unused/extra files and folders
- [x] Ensure clean, optimized structure

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- [x] Implement backend API for Encryption Manager
- [x] Set up database models (MongoDB) for encryption-related data
- [x] Implement encryption/decryption services
- [x] Add authentication and authorization middleware
- [x] Create API routes for key management, encryption operations
- [x] Integrate LLM for intelligent encryption recommendations
- [x] Add error handling and logging
- [x] Test backend functionality

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [x] Design world-class UI/UX for Encryption Manager
- [x] Implement encryption key management interface
- [x] Add real-time encryption/decryption tools
- [x] Integrate AI assistance features
- [x] Ensure responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- [x] Add navigation and dashboard components
- [x] Implement API integration with backend
- [x] Test frontend functionality

### Phase 4: Database (MongoDB) Setup
- [x] Design MongoDB schema for Encryption Manager
- [x] Set up collections for keys, encrypted data, audit logs
- [x] Implement data validation and indexing
- [x] Add database connection and configuration
- [x] Test database operations

### Phase 5: LLM Integration
- [x] Integrate Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.5 for intelligent recommendations
- [x] Implement AI-powered encryption suggestions
- [x] Add natural language processing for encryption queries
- [x] Ensure reliable and intelligent model performance

### Phase 6: Domain and URL Structure
- [x] Configure domain: maula.ai (home page)
- [x] Set up subdomain: encryptionmanager.maula.ai
- [x] Implement neural-link-interface as AI realtime live streaming
- [x] Add LIVE AI Assistance option: encryptionmanager.maula.ai/maula-ai
- [x] Ensure URL pattern: [tool-name].maula.ai/maula-ai consistent across tools

### Phase 7: Documentation and README
- [x] Create README.md in backend/tools/14-encryptionmanager/
- [x] Document backend structure and API details
- [x] Document frontend architecture and components
- [x] Document database schema and models
- [x] Include setup and deployment instructions
- [x] Add tool-specific features and usage

### Phase 8: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing
- [ ] Validate security features
- [ ] Test AI integration
- [ ] Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 9: Branching and Deployment
- [ ] Create new branch: feature/tool-14-encryptionmanager
- [ ] Commit all changes
- [ ] Push branch to remote
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Merge to main branch
- [ ] Checkout main branch
- [ ] Repeat process for next tool (15-cryptovault)

## General Requirements
