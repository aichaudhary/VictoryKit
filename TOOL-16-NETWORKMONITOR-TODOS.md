# Model Recommendations Reliable & Intelligent For Best Performance Overall - Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.5

## Overall Project Workflow
- [x] Merge existing branch and checkout main branch
- [x] Work on main branch for development
- [ ] For each tool: Complete backend, frontend, database (MongoDB), LM integration
- [ ] After completing a tool: Create new branch, commit, push, merge to main, checkout main
- [ ] Repeat cycle for each tool (one tool at a time, 360-degree completion)

## Tool Development Process (Tool 16: NetworkMonitor)
### Phase 1: Preparation and Cleanup
- [ ] Identify tool 16: NetworkMonitor (16-networkmonitor)
- [ ] Check real-world usage of NetworkMonitor tools
- [ ] Analyze how to design frontend for world-class premium VVIP experience
- [ ] Delete unnecessary parts from copied fguard structure
- [ ] Update/upgrade code according to NetworkMonitor's specific nature and usage
- [ ] Delete any neural-link-interface/ folders in frontend/tools/16-networkmonitor/
- [ ] Remove legacy/duplicate/copy/unused/extra files and folders
- [ ] Ensure clean, optimized structure

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- [ ] Implement backend API for NetworkMonitor
- [ ] Set up database models (MongoDB) for network monitoring data
- [ ] Implement network traffic analysis services
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization middleware
- [ ] Create API routes for network monitoring, traffic analysis
- [ ] Integrate LLM for intelligent network recommendations
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Test backend functionality

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [ ] Design world-class UI/UX for NetworkMonitor
- [ ] Implement network traffic monitoring interface
- [ ] Add real-time traffic analysis and visualization tools
- [ ] Integrate AI assistance features
- [ ] Ensure responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Add navigation and dashboard components
- [ ] Implement API integration with backend
- [ ] Test frontend functionality

### Phase 4: Database (MongoDB) Setup
- [ ] Design MongoDB schema for NetworkMonitor
- [ ] Set up collections for traffic logs, network devices, alerts
- [ ] Implement data validation and indexing
- [ ] Add database connection and configuration
- [ ] Test database operations

### Phase 5: LLM Integration
- [ ] Integrate Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.5 for intelligent recommendations
- [ ] Implement AI-powered network analysis suggestions
- [ ] Add natural language processing for network queries
- [ ] Ensure reliable and intelligent model performance

### Phase 6: Domain and URL Structure
- [ ] Configure domain: maula.ai (home page)
- [ ] Set up subdomain: networkmonitor.maula.ai
- [ ] Implement neural-link-interface as AI realtime live streaming
- [ ] Add LIVE AI Assistance option: networkmonitor.maula.ai/maula-ai
- [ ] Ensure URL pattern: [tool-name].maula.ai/maula-ai consistent across tools

### Phase 7: Documentation and README
- [ ] Create README.md in backend/tools/16-networkmonitor/
- [ ] Document backend structure and API details
- [ ] Document frontend architecture and components
- [ ] Document database schema and models
- [ ] Include setup and deployment instructions
- [ ] Add tool-specific features and usage

### Phase 8: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing
- [ ] Validate security features
- [ ] Test AI integration
- [ ] Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 9: Branching and Deployment
- [ ] Create new branch: feature/tool-16-networkmonitor
- [ ] Commit all changes
- [ ] Push branch to remote
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Merge to main branch
- [ ] Checkout main branch
- [ ] Repeat process for next tool (17-audittrail)

## General Requirements
- [ ] Ensure 4 groups follow same workflow
- [ ] Maintain consistency across all 50 tools
- [ ] Delete any duplicate or legacy code
- [ ] Optimize for best performance
- [ ] World-class premium VVIP user experience
- [ ] Complete 360-degree implementation per tool

## Rewards Tracking
- [ ] Track top-performing tools for rewards
- [ ] Best 10 tools get iPhone + $5,000 each
- [ ] Focus on scalability, world-class quality</content>
